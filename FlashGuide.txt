Sure! Here's a detailed, step-by-step guide for flashing MicroPython firmware to ESP32 boards using esptool, customized with the paths you're using:

Step-by-Step Guide for Flashing MicroPython on ESP32
1. Install Required Tools
Ensure you have esptool installed inside your virtual environment. You've already done this, but for future boards, if needed:

bash
Copy code
pip install esptool
2. Erase Flash on the ESP32
Each time you flash a new ESP32 board, it’s good practice to first erase the flash memory:

bash
Copy code
esptool --chip esp32 --port COM15 --baud 115200 erase_flash
Replace COM15 with the actual COM port your ESP32 is connected to.
This will clear any existing firmware and settings on the ESP32.
3. Download MicroPython Firmware
Make sure you've downloaded the MicroPython firmware. In your case, the firmware is already at:

bash
Copy code
D:\Uni\Skripsie\Firmware\ESP32_GENERIC-20240602-v1.23.0.bin
If needed for future boards, you can always get the latest MicroPython firmware for ESP32 from the official site: MicroPython Download Page.

4. Flash MicroPython Firmware
Once the flash is erased, proceed to flash the MicroPython firmware. Use the following command:

bash
Copy code
esptool --chip esp32 --port COM15 --baud 115200 write_flash -z 0x1000 D:\Uni\Skripsie\Firmware\ESP32_GENERIC-20240602-v1.23.0.bin
Replace COM15 with the COM port of the new ESP32 board you are working with.
The path to the firmware should remain the same as long as you are using the same .bin file.
0x1000 is the starting address where the firmware should be written on the flash.
5. Hard Reset the ESP32
After the firmware is flashed, the ESP32 will automatically reset via the RTS pin. If it doesn’t, you can manually reset the board by pressing the EN (reset) button.

6. Access MicroPython REPL
Once the board is flashed with MicroPython, you can access the REPL to interact with the board directly using Python. Here’s how you can do it:

For Windows (Using PuTTY):

Open PuTTY.
Set the COM port to COM15 and the baud rate to 115200.
Click Open, and you should see the >>> prompt.
For Linux/macOS (Using Screen):

Open a terminal and use the following command:
bash
Copy code
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
Replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with your ESP32's port.
Press CTRL + A, then CTRL + D to exit.
Alternatively, you can use an IDE like Thonny or uPyCraft that provides easy access to the REPL.

7. Repeat for Other Boards
For each new ESP32 board, repeat the process:

Change the COM port in the commands to reflect the new board.
Follow the same steps to erase the flash and write the firmware.
